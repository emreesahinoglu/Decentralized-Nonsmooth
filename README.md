### Decentralized Online to Nonconvex Conversion Algorithm Implementation

## Datasets
Datasets can be downloaded from [this link](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/). Datasets must be located in upper level folder '../datasets/'.

## Results

You should make 'results' directory to save the results. In the 'results' directory you should have 'first' , 'zero' , 'dgfm', 'rho', 'er' folders.

## Simulations

# Our Algorithm 

You can use DecO2NC_sim.py to evaluate our algorithm. You can change 'oracle_setup' variable to 'zero' or 'first' to use zero/first order oracles.

# DGFM Algorithm

You can use DGFM_sim.py to evaluate DGFM algorithm.

# DPSGD Algorithm

You can use DPSGD_sim.py to evaluate DPSGD algorithm.

# Ring Graph Experiments

You can use ring_graph_sim.py to evaluate the effect of $\rho$.

# Random Graph Experiments

You can use random_graph_sim.py to evaluate the algorithm with Erdos Renyi random graphs.
